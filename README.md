# Private_Medical_Practitioner_System
A private medical doctor requires a software system to help them manage their business. We have been engaged to develop this system. The  requirements are meant to help our team to understand what the system is supposed to do. The system will have four (4) types of users â€“ System Administrators, Doctors, Office Assistants and Customers (Patients).
